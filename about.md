Hi, I'm Guilhem! 

I am a data scientist and consultant working in London. I design, build and deploy advanced analytics solutions that use machine learning to solve a variety of problems across multiple industries (with a particular focus on retail analytics).

Throughout my education, I have kept a keen interest in Life Sciences and Data Science. 
In fact, I have been working at the interface of both, while doing a PhD in Systems Biology in Cambridge (at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology).
