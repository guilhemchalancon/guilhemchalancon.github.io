Hi, I'm Guilhem! Among other things, I am first and foremost passionate about the idea of understanding and predicting the behaviour of complex systems with the help of data science. That's what drives my intellectual curiosity, and hence my career. 

Currently, I am a data scientist and consultant working in London. A large part of my work consists of designing, building and deploying advanced analytics solutions that use machine learning to solve a variety of problems across multiple industries (with a particular focus on retail analytics). The other part is concerned with change management, client relationship management, business development and training. 

Throughout my education, I have kept a keen interest in Science, and more specifically Life sciences (first), followed by Data science (soon after). In fact, I ended up working at the interface of both when I undertook a PhD in Cambridge. I used statistical and computational models leveraging on sequencing and -omics data to study the control of gene expression in a broad sense, i.e. at various scales (evolutionary, regulatory, genomic etc.).
Most of my research was conducted in the lab of Madan M. Babu at the MRC [Laboratory of Molecular Biology](http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/)).


Below is a very short resume. You will find more details on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhemchalancon/).

### Where I am from 

I grew up in a small village, the location of which seems to confuse most people I meet :-). So here it is:

As you can see, it sits at the feet of the French Pyrenees mountains, on the Mediterranean side.

Some say that this place is blessed for its weather, geography and gastronomy. Years of British weather, British food, and the sadly infamous British bathroom taps have convinced me that there is some truth to it. 
This is not to say that Great Britain does not have its own <a class="surprise">gems...</a>
