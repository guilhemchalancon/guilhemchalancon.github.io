title: Hello world

It has been two years since I finished my PhD in Cambridge, and I thought now would be a good time to build a new personal webpage, similar to [the one](http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/guilhem) I made 
during my time in Cambridge.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/old_website.png)

This time, I have opted to build a blog maintain with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
When time allows, I'll be playing around with [d3.js](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [R markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

Stay tuned!
