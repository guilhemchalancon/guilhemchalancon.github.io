title: Hello world

I have finally decided to restore a web presence by building a brand new personal webpage. 
Please note that my Cambridge student [website](http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/genomes/guilhem) is outdated (I have long finished my PhD).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
